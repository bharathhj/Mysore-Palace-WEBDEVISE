 			<h2>ABOUT&nbsp;:</h2>
 			<p><br><br>The Golden Howdah (elephant seat or Chinnada Ambari in Kannada) is a howdah, the carrier mounted on the leading elephant during the Jamboo Savari (Elephant Procession) of the famous Mysore Dasara. It is the cynosure[citation needed] of all eyes during the famous Dasara festivities. Since 2012, it has been carried by Arjuna

			<br><br>The exact date of its making is not known. The 750-kg-howdah, used in the Jamboo Savari (elephant procession) on the Vijayadashami day, has two wide seats in rows, bigger than the interiors of a family car. The Rajas of Mysore used this howdah in the famous Dasara procession, which traversed through the thoroughfares of the princely city during the festival every year. But since the abolition of royalty the statue of Chamundeshwari is being carried in the howdah. The Howdah is made of Pure gold. The core structure is wood and it was covered in filigreed gold sheets weighing 60 kilograms by "Swarnakala Nipuna" Singannacharya. It has three deftly carved pillars on each of the four sides. It is covered with a canopy resembling a crown. There are five sacred "Kalashas" on top of it. The seat itself is made of silver, alluring designs embellishing it.And it will be shown in only dasara times.

			<br><br>The golden Howdah is mounted on the lead elephant with the idol of deity (Nadadevathe) Chamundeshwari placed in it. The procession of over 5.5 kilometers passes through the Mysore city, beginning at Mysore Palace and terminating at Bannimantap. The elephant carrying the Howdah is trained and groomed to do the job years before it actually does it. Balarama has the distinction of participating in the procession 19 times and has carried the Howdah on thirteen occasions, between 1999 and 2011. After taking over from him in 2012, Arjuna has been the carrier.

			<br><br>Mysore Dasara is the Nadahabba (state festival) of the state of Karnataka in India. It is a 10-day festival, starting with nine nights called Navaratri and the last day being Vijayadashami. The festival is observed on the tenth day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashvin, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October.

			<br><br>The Hindu festival of Dasara, Navratri and Vijayadashami celebrates the victory of good over evil. It was the day in the Hindu legends when Goddess Chamundeshwari (Durga) killed the demon Mahishasura. Mahishasura is the demon whose slaying by the Goddess gave the city the name Mysuru. The Mysuru tradition celebrates the warriors and the state fighting for the good during this festival, ritually worshipping and displaying the state sword, weapons, elephants, horses along with Hindu Devi goddess in her warrior form (predominantly) as well as the Vishnu avatar Rama. The ceremonies and a major procession is traditionally presided by the king of Mysuru.

			<div class="jumbotron_5"></div>

			<br><br>The city of Mysuru has a long tradition of celebrating the Dasara festival with grandeur and pomp to mark the festival. The Dasara festival in Mysuru completed 409th anniversary in the year 2019, while evidence suggests the festivities were observed in Karnataka state by the Vijayanagara Empire kings in the 15th century.
